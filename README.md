# Family Recipes

A rough sketch of my future Demo Day project "Family Recipes". My goal for this project is to empower children of immigrants like myself to start recording and saving family recipes. Many recipes aren't written down or shared via word of mouth. I wanted a place where all of my cherished family recipes could be kept safe, as well as having the option to share them with others. 

Another smaller feature of this app will be a photo uploader. Remembering our loved ones through images and their food is something very special to me.
